I have always felt let down as java developer about Sun websites.. They make a bad example of themselves in web. Opposed to Microsoft and Adobe who make stunning first impressions.  
  
Sun should do more sites like this ..simple and informative.  
  
Check it out.. I'm sure you will like the cool new look.
