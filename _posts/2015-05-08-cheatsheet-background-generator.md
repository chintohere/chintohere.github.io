# Cheatsheet to Background Image generator

Okay this is an idea which hit me during a train ride home... 

Wouldn't it be cool to generate Hiqh Quality color coded cheat sheets as JPEG or PNG backgrounds..

## Input

There should be a pictorial drag & drop of elements on web using HTML 5 canvas

## Output

A high definition image generated in JPEG or PNG format in desired resolution

It will be a cool project to showcase Fonts/Image Generation/Canvas/Clound in a single project

*** Let's see if anything comes out of it ***
