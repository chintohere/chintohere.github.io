If you already use a good tool to do screen captures, you can pretty much  ignore this and checkout this good alternative  
  


[Gadwin  Printscreen](http://www.download.com/Gadwin-PrintScreen/3000-2094_4-10123018.html?tag=lst-8&cdlPid=10727558)

As with all the emphasis on knowledge sharing and stuff. I have been trying  to put all the important items into shared documents/wiki on sharepoint for  Horizon.

And one of first frustating points about this is being forced to type  lot's of text. I hate typing lots of text/more than being forced to go through  it. I naturally prefer screen shots (with the belief a picture's worth a  thousand words). Which in turn made me realize how basic the windows PrintScreen  button is.  
  


After a bit of research I came across this nice tool  
  


[**Gadwin  Printscreen**](http://www.download.com/Gadwin-PrintScreen/3000-2094_4-10123018.html?tag=lst-8&cdlPid=10727558)** 4.3** which lets you take screen shots  of 

  * Whole Screen  
  * Active WIndow  
  * A Custom Square...  
  * Save them to a pre-determined location...  
  * Open them up for preview

All at a touch of a button with little initial configuration. Give it a go..  it's very neat...

I've downloaded it and placed in H:\eBusiness Team\Software\Screen  Capture\PrintScreen43_Setup.exe

check it out..
