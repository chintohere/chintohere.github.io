I do and I believe that is the biggest improvement in usability Vista has  achieved (yeah, more useful than all the Flip 3D and eye candy).  
  


Now you can get all that on XP itself. (Acutally this has been there all  along)

Try [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/#download) at [http://www.launchy.net/](http://www.launchy.net/)  
  


It's cool and has a light footprint of 15MB and stays there.  
  


AND DO NOT FORGET TO READ THE README FILE, It tells you a lot.
