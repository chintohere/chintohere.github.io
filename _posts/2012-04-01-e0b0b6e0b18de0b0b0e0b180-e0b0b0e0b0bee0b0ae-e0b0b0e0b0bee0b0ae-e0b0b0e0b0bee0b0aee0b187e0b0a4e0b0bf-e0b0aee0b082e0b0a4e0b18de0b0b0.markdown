_I have decided to write some of the devotional text we learn in Telugu font so it is available for wider audience and can be read on any screens (Mobile/Table/PC) screens on any resolution on can be printed nicely as well. Coming from a background of Telugu medium, it does feel nice to be able to write in [Telugu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language) again. Let's keep Telugu alive and well._

Sri Rama Rama Rameti Mantra on occasion of  Sri Rama Navami.

> శ్రీ రామ రామ రామేతి
రమే రామే మనోరమే
సహస్రనామ తత్ తుల్యం
రామ నామ వరాననే
