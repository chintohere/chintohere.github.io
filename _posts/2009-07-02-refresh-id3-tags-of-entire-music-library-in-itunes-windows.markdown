If you are like me and manage your ID3 tags outside iTunes for your music, this is how you force iTunes to refresh all ID3 info without having to recreate the entire library.



	
  1. Select all songs (Ctrl+A)

	
  2. Right click the selection, click on 'Get info'

	
  3. Without entering any data, just click on 'Ok' this will force iTunes to refresh ID3 info.
NOTE: Care full not to enter anything in the 'Get info' dialog when it is open. Because anything you enter will be applied to all songs.


Voila! that should do it.
