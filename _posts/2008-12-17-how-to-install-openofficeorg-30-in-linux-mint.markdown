This is pretty simple in the linux mint. (You usually already have OpenOffice.org 2.4 which comes by default, so this is more like an upgrade procedure)

You add the OpenOffice deb repository as this is not yet available from Ubuntu reps and do a mintUpdate which will quickly tell you what is ready to be updated. Here we go.

**Step 1** - Add openoffice.org repository. To do this first open Synaptic Package Manger, Go to Setting>Repositories. Click new which will add new repository at the end of list. Add the following details as shown in screenshot for the new repository entry. Then press ok to save.

**Step 2:** Open mintUpdate (Menu>Administration>mintUpdate) and click on **Refresh**, Which will now show all the updates for open office. Click installl updates
