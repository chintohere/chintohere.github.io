This is got to be one hell of a car ride. I was planning on a road trip to Blue Mountains (NSW, Aus) for this upcomnig long weekend. So I started planning out my route in Google Maps and Being the lazy guy I was I never bothered to type in the state after 'Blue Mountains'. Check out the route I got....

This may even be replicated now... Just try calculating the route now to 'Blue Mountains' at http://maps.google.com.au/ without typing in the state.  
  
  
That will be one hell of ride even in a 007's car... :)
