Hello Everyone..

I'm in the process of moving off my hosting to a github hosted site powered by jekyll. <a href="http://kishore.chintoju.com" title="kishore.chintoju.com" target="_blank">kishore.chintoju.com</a>

Couple of reasons for this.

 * Cost
 * East of use and backups
 * Keeps all my content in a single place
 * Learn the new way, new tech.. pure fun
 * Using a discussion board such as Disqus to avoid managing the comments
