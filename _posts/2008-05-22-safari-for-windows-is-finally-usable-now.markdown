Safari for windows is out of beta and finally usable now. I have been eagerly waiting for this release and have tried out various beta versions before. As expected beta versions had so many bugs that it was virtually unusable for some sites and on corporate networks.  
  
I have been trying out the [Safari 3.0](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/) for a couple of days now. It is quite cool to see all the eye candy on windows xp. It looks cool and runs smooth on most standards compliant websites. Which is fine with me as I don't go to too many IE specific crappy websites as I use firefox as my main browser.  
  
I have just downloaded [Firefox 3.0 Release Candidate 1](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/05/16/firefox-3-release-candidate-now-available-for-download/) and I have to say it's so much better. Awesome bar (Address Bar) is really awesome. That is so easy to use and labels/tags for bookmars are in, which is very future thinking. It may be confusing to traditional users who would like to organize their bookmarks in folders. But believe me, just be patient it will be worth it. Once you cross hundred bookmarks it becomes really hard to manage the traditional way. I have been using labels in gmail for a while now and it's way better than folders.  
  
But I'm having my fingers crossed on most important of them all MEMORY BLOAT. So far it seems to be reasonable. But I will keep you posted.
